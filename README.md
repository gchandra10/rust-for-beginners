# Rust for Beginners

Contains scripts covering Rust basics. Some may seem to be complicated, but they are not.

## How to Create a new package

By default you cannot create a package name starting with numeric value. So parameter --name is used so Rust 
creates a folder with xx_ and package name with different text.

```cargo new 01_hello --name hello```

## List of Examples

- 01_hello/
- 02_variable/
- 03_mutable_variable/
- 04_while_loop/
- 05_for_loop/
- 06_loop/
